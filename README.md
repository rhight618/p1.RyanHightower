# Microwave Interface - Project 1

![alt text](SharpMicroInterface.jpg)

## Issues With Current Design

1. There are 5 labels underneath the timer display that are not self-explanitory as to what they represent
2. The **Sensor Cook** Menu is confusing as to how much time or the condition the food needs to be in before the setting to be effective.  Does the microwave *sense* the food and type? Or is it just a pre-set?
3. The listed items next the **Soften** picture are confusing.  Is that how many times the user should press the **+30 sec** button to the right of it?
4. The **Express** Cook Label appears to only refer to the 2 button.  The braces around the 1,4 and 3,6 buttons are also confusing.
