<h2>Issues With Current Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li>There are 5 labels underneath the timer display that are not self-explanitory as to what they represent</li>
  <li>The <strong>Sensor Cook</strong> Menu is confusing as to how much time or the condition the food needs to be in before the setting to be effective.  Does the microwave *sense* the food and type? Or is it just a pre-set?</li>
  <li>The listed items next the <strong>Soften</strong> picture are confusing.  Is that how many times the user should press the <strong>+30 sec</strong> button to the right of it?</li>
  <li>The <strong>Express</strong> Cook Label appears to only refer to the 2 button.  The braces around the 1,4 and 3,6 buttons are also confusing.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">You can <strong style="background-color: #317399; padding: 0 5px; color: #fff;">type your text</strong> directly in the editor or paste it from a Word Doc, PDF, Excel etc.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">The <strong>visual editor</strong> on the right and the <strong>source editor</strong> on the left are linked together and the changes are reflected in the other one as you type! <img src="https://html5-editor.net/images/smiley.png" alt="smiley" /></p>

<p>This is a table you can experiment with.</p>
