<h2>Issues With Current Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li>There are 5 labels underneath the timer display that are not self-explanitory as to what they represent</li>
  <li>The <strong>Sensor Cook</strong> Menu is confusing as to how much time or the condition the food needs to be in before the setting to be effective.  Does the microwave *sense* the food and type? Or is it just a pre-set?</li>
  <li>The listed items next the <strong>Soften</strong> picture are confusing.  Is that how many times the user should press the <strong>+30 sec</strong> button to the right of it?</li>
  <li>The <strong>Express</strong> Cook Label appears to only refer to the 2 button.  The braces around the 1,4 and 3,6 buttons are also confusing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Uses of a Microwave</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Cooking Food</li>
  <li>Reheating Food</li>
  <li>Boiling Water</li>
  <li>Defrosting Frozen Food</li>
</ol>

<h3>The inteface makes these common uses cases realtively easy.  Most require time-based heating which can be accomplished with simple time settings. The interface falls a little short in having proper timing assocatiated with common food types like potatoes, boiling water.</h3>

<h2>Rare Uses of Microwaves</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Heating beauty products</li>
  <li>De-crystalization science experiments</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Mistakes Made</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Forgetting that buttons 1-6 are Express Cooking Presets.  You must click Time Cook first for setting specific time</li>
  <li>Assuming that the Popcorn preset will cook for the exact correct amount of time.  If the bag is smaller you will likely scorch the popcorn</li>
</ol>
