<h2>Issues With Current Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li>There are 5 labels underneath the timer display that are not self-explanitory as to what they represent</li>
  <li>The <strong>Sensor Cook</strong> Menu is confusing as to how much time or the condition the food needs to be in before the setting to be effective.  Does the microwave *sense* the food and type? Or is it just a pre-set?</li>
  <li>The listed items next the <strong>Soften</strong> picture are confusing.  Is that how many times the user should press the <strong>+30 sec</strong> button to the right of it?</li>
  <li>The <strong>Express</strong> Cook Label appears to only refer to the 2 button.  The braces around the 1,4 and 3,6 buttons are also confusing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Uses of Microwaves</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Cooking Food</li>
  <li>Reheating Food</li>
  <li>Boiling Water</li>
  <li>Defrosting Frozen Food</li>
</ol>

<h2>Less Common Uses of Microwaves</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Medicine - decreasing the size of enlarged organs</li>
  <li>Sanitization - Cleaning up pollution</li>
  <li>Science - seperating chemical compounds</li>
  <li>Communications - cell phones, televisions, satellites</li>
</ol>
