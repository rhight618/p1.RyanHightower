<h1>Project 1: Microwave Interface</h1>

<h3>Microwave Control Panel</h3>

<h3>Issues With Current Design</h3>

<ol>
  <li>There are 5 labels underneath the timer display that are not self-explanitory as to what they represent</li>
  <li>The <strong>Sensor Cook</strong> Menu is confusing as to how much time or the condition the food needs to be in before the setting to be effective.  Does the microwave *sense* the food and type? Or is it just a pre-set?</li>
  <li>The listed items next the <strong>Soften</strong> picture are confusing.  Is that how many times the user should press the <strong>+30 sec</strong> button to the right of it?</li>
  <li>The <strong>Express</strong> Cook Label appears to only refer to the number 2 button.  The braces around the 1,4 and 3,6 buttons are also confusing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Section B: Microwave Usage and Proposed Design</h2>

<h3>Common Microwave Uses</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Cooking Food</li>
  <li>Reheating Food</li>
  <li>Boiling Water</li>
  <li>Defrosting Frozen Food</li>
</ol>

<p>The inteface makes these common uses cases realtively easy.  Most require time-based heating which can be accomplished with simple time settings. The interface falls a little short in having proper timing assocatiated with common food types like potatoes, boiling water.</p>

<h3>Rare Microwaves Uses</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Heating beauty products</li>
  <li>De-crystalization science experiments</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Sequences of Actions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Place food in oven -> Close Door -> Press Time Cook -> Enter in Time on number pad -> Press Start</li>
  <li>Place food in oven -> Close Door -> Press one of the Express Cook Numbers to cook for the corresponding minutes</li>
  <li>Place food in oven -> Close Door -> Press one of the Express Cook Numbers to cook for the corresponding minutes -> Add 30 secs by pressing the +30sec buttons</li>
</ol>

<h3>User Support and Feedback</h3>

<ol>
  <li>This microwave makes audible beeps" when buttons are pressed</li>
  <li>When the cooking time is complete multiple beeps are sounded to notify the user</li>
  <li>A display shows the current time left in the cooking cycle as well as when a time is being typed in</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Mistakes Made</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Forgetting that buttons 1-6 are Express Cooking Presets.  You must click Time Cook first for setting specific time</li>
  <li>Assuming that the Popcorn preset will cook for the exact correct amount of time.  If the bag is smaller you will likely scorch the popcorn</li>
</ol>

<h3>Suggested Improvements to Design</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Eliminate the Sensor Cook Menu all together because the sesnor cooking is not accurate and leaves the food undercooked/overcooked</li>
  <li>Emiminate the "Soften" Picture.  It is confusing to the user as to what he/she is supposed to do to use it.  It is not a button but merely instructions</li>
  <li>Alter the Express Cook functionality since it can be easy to forget that by pressing the number cooking starts immidiately.  Add a button for Express Cook which is then followed by a numbered button selection.  This puts the user in a position to always have to choose timed cooking or express cooking</li>
  <li>Add a section for Programable Preset buttons.  The user will be able to add a custom name and set the cooking time.  Once this is saved, the user will be able to press the button for express cooking</li>
  <li>Keep the +30 button. It is handy for adding extra time when trying to guess at cooking time</li>
  <li>Add letters to the bottom of each numbered button to be used when naming a preset button</li>
  <li>Add a section with step by step instructions for setting a Preset Button</li>
</ol>
